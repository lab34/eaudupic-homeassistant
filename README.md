# EauDuPic Integration for Home Assistant

This integration is forked from https://github.com/LouisForaux/saur-homeassistant
And adapted to work with this water provider https://eaudupic.client.ccgpsl.fr/public/connexion

Note: SensorStateClass is MEASUREMENT here (and it was TOTAL_INCREASING in SaurClient)
